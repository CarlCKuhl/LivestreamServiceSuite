I didn't really like having to install the ATEM software, and then having to manually update each project COM reference to point at the BMDSwitcherAPI com object.

I've instead included the ATEM SDK include files directly, from which I've build a dll that is then referenced
(yes this may not be ideal having committed binary files... but we don't really want to change them too often, and its not sooo huge)

STEPS to generate the dll:

- download (or find/use the local copy) ATEM SDK

in the 'include' folder run:
1. `MIDL ./BMDSwitcherAPI.dll` (which sould generate a .tlb from the .idl)
2. `tlbimp.exe ./BMDSwitcherAPI.tlb` (which will turn the created .tlb into a .dll we can use)
3. manually edit the .csproj for all projects that need a reference. Set the <HintPath>../relative/sln/path</HintPath> for the reference
