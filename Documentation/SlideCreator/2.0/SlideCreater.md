# Slide Creater

The purpose of slide creater is to automate as much as possible, the create of presentations (SEE TODO PRESENTATION) for use by *Integrated Presenter*

The basic principle *Slide Creater* follows is to more akin to a typesetter than a word-processor. It has a concept of layouts/templates for how various elements should be displayed/handled, and then fills that based on provided content. Accordingly, there's a firm distinction between content, layout and generated output.
This is in contrast to other tools you may be familiar with (i.e. MS Word or PowerPoint) where the output is the same as what you edit, and layout is often manually performed and closely depends on the content.
