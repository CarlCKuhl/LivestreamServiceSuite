# Roadmap

This is a general list of developments that are planned for Slide Creater

- naming this is hard: open to better names for:
	- slides
	- presentation
	- 'Slide Creater' (including correct spelling)
	- Integrated Presenter (yuck)


## Slide Rendering

### Commands to make layout aware:
- #liturgy

- #liturgyverse is this even used -> deprecate?

- #unscaledimage
- #scaledimage
- #autoscaledimage

- #filterimage

- #liturgyimage (partially...)
	- general case of advanced image

### layouts needed for
- closing title slide ?

### Commands to transition to imagesharp

- #liturgy
- #liturgyverse
- #unscaledimage
- #scaledimage
- #autoscaledimage
- #prefab



## Autocomplete
- most commands need to implement suggestions
- need to rework suggestion algorithm to correctly compute what to suggest for
- perhaps just build a whole separate compiler for this (make use of the existing Recognize() function)
