P If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\\
C But if we confess our sins, God, who is faithful and just, will forgive our sins and
cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\
P Let us then confess our sins to God our Father.\\
C Most merciful God, we confess that we are by nature sinful and unclean. We have
sinned against You in thought, word, and deed, by what we have done and by
what we have left undone. We have not loved You with our whole heart; we have
not loved our neighbors as ourselves. We justly deserve Your present and eternal
punishment. For the sake of Your Son, Jesus Christ, have mercy on us. Forgive
us, renew us, and lead us, so that we may delight in Your will and walk in Your
ways to the glory of Your holy name. Amen.\\
P In the mercy of almighty God, Jesus Christ was given to die for us, and for His sake God

has begun this good work in us, bring it to completion in the day of our Lord Jesus
Christ.\\
