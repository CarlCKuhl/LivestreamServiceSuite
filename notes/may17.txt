Your grace for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.\\
C O most merciful God, who has given Your only-begotten Son to die for us, have
mercy upon us and for His sake grant us remission of all our sins; and by Your
Holy Spirit increase in us true knowledge of You and of Your will and true
obedience to Your Word, to the end that by Your grace we may come to
everlasting life; through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.\\
P Almighty God, our heavenly Father, has had mercy upon us and has given His only Son

He that believes and is baptized shall be saved.
Grant this, Lord, unto us all.\\
