TODO:

Slide Creater:

- paramaterized layouts
- finish all commands as layout aware
	- liturgy
	- litimage (allow different key/color editing)
	- texthymn
	- fitimage/fullimage ?? (perhaps)
	- finish up filterchain (now that we can modify child slides)
	- add only script to scripted (priority = only->last/first->all->none)
	
	- prefab for now can be modified via a filterchain perhaps

- autocomplete
	- add to all commands
	- fix nesting algorithm
	- update metadata? to support this

- fullscreen preview slide

- script
	- better way to handle camera source numbers ($CAM1) and we can provide a BMDSwitcherConfig I guess (use the default)
	- way to set the config files on presentations - could edit them here too!
	- command to add them??

- unify syntax?? (BREAKING CHANGE)
	- may need to build a converter


Integrated Presenter:

- idea: hotreload presentation (may not work?, would need to dump all slides and release all resources)
- idea: altcontent (may not have enough things/displayresources)
- idea: truly refactor automation out
- idea: cleanup/optimize UI
- idea: compromise event/slides -> turn slides into the media engine
	- add new column to UI
	- put event list there (with icons to make it look purty)
	- remap UP/DOWN keys from mediacontrol to event control
	- (media control i.e. scrubbers on videos/audio?) (media control can probably be unified with F1/2/3/4 and an appropriate mod key)
	- need to think how next/prev slide works with next/prev event.... (but this can be an optional feature)
	- if enabled slide automation is disabled, will use slides only as graphics-> relies on event automation
	- so pick your mode...
	- need to have 2 types of published output in slide creater
	- would allow a unification of the hotmess that's the project/slide output
